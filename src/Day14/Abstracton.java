		 * Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details 
		 * and showing only the functionality to user.
		 * Data Abstraction can be achieve by using
		 * 1)Interface----100 percent abstraction can be achieved
		 * 2)Abstract class-----complete abstraction cannot be achieved
		 * 
		 * Interface
		 * -------------------
		 * An interface is a blue print of class.
		 * Interface contains final and static variables
		 * Interface contains abstract methods(also allowed default methods and static methods from java8onwards)
		 * An abstract method contains signature but not body(Unimplemented method)
		 * Methods in interface are public
		 * Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance
		 * We can define interface with interface keyword
		 * A class extends another class an interface extends another interface but a class implements an interface
		 * We can create object reference for interface but we cannot instantiate interface
		 * class Test{
		 * void m(){
		 * implementation
		 * }
		 * }
		 * 
		 * Interface Test{
		 * void m();
		 * }
		 * 
		 *
